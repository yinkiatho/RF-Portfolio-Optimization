        Trained on historical data from 1999 to 2014, the model aims predict the returns of stocks in the next month. \
        Based on a desired number of stocks, the stocks with the highest predicted returns are then selected to be part of the portfolio. \
        Comparison is made between portfolios optimised using the Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) algorithm, Naive Portfolio Diversification and Mean-Variance Optimisations Techniques, \
        aiming to maximise Sharpe Ratio. \
        These weights are then used to construct a new portfolio as to which its performance is evaluated against the S&P 500 Index.")
